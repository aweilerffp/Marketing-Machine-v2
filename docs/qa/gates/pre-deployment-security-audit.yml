# ============================================
# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
# ============================================
executive_summary: |
  Pre-deployment security audit completed for Marketing Machine application before
  Hetzner VPS deployment. The audit identified CRITICAL security concerns that must
  be addressed before production release.

  **GATE DECISION: FAIL** ‚ùå

  **Key Findings:**
  - üî¥ CRITICAL: Exposed Anthropic API key in local .env file (must rotate)
  - üî¥ HIGH: Axios dependency vulnerability (DoS attack vector)
  - üü° MEDIUM: Missing ENCRYPTION_KEY for token encryption (using insecure default)
  - üü° MEDIUM: Auth bypass flag enabled (must disable for production)
  - üü° LOW: Clerk dependency vulnerabilities (3 low-severity issues)

  **Positive Findings:**
  ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets in source code
  ‚úÖ .env files properly excluded from git
  ‚úÖ Good API key validation middleware
  ‚úÖ Token encryption implemented (AES-256-CBC)
  ‚úÖ Proper authentication middleware with Clerk

top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: high
    category: "Secret Exposure"
    finding: "Active Anthropic API key present in backend/.env file"
    location: "backend/.env:26"
    details: |
      The backend/.env file contains what appears to be an active Anthropic API key:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-Hek7SU5Y... [REDACTED - 108 characters total]

      While the .env file is not committed to git (‚úÖ), the key prefix was exposed through:
      1. Security audit conversation
      2. Local file access
      3. Potential backup copies

      NOTE: This key has been ROTATED and REVOKED as of 2025-10-14.
    suggested_action: |
      **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
      1. Rotate the Anthropic API key immediately via Anthropic dashboard
      2. Generate a new production key with usage limits
      3. Store new key securely (see recommendations below)
      4. Update SECURITY_PATTERNS.EXPOSED_PREFIXES in apiKeyValidation.js to block this key

  - id: "DEP-001"
    severity: high
    category: "Dependency Vulnerability"
    finding: "Axios vulnerable to DoS attack (CVE GHSA-4hjh-wcwx-xvwj)"
    location: "backend/package.json:34"
    details: |
      Axios version 1.11.0 is vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks through lack
      of data size check. CVSS Score: 7.5/10 (High)

      Affected version range: 1.0.0 - 1.11.0
      Current version: 1.11.0
    suggested_action: |
      Update axios to version 1.12.0 or later:
      ```bash
      cd backend && npm update axios
      npm audit fix
      ```

      - "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4hjh-wcwx-xvwj"
      - "backend/package.json:34"

  - id: "SEC-002"
    severity: medium
    category: "Encryption Security"
    finding: "Missing ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable - using insecure default"
    location: "backend/src/services/encryption.js:4"
    details: |
      The encryption service falls back to a default key when ENCRYPTION_KEY is not set:

      ```javascript
      const ENCRYPTION_KEY = process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY || crypto.scryptSync('default-key', 'salt', 32);
      ```

      This default key is:
      1. Predictable and deterministic
      2. Same across all deployments without explicit ENCRYPTION_KEY
      3. Can be reverse-engineered from source code

      This is used to encrypt sensitive tokens (LinkedIn OAuth tokens, etc.) stored in the
      PlatformConnection table.
    suggested_action: |
      1. Generate a secure random 32-byte encryption key:
         ```bash
         node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
         ```
      2. Add to production .env file:
         ENCRYPTION_KEY="<generated_key>"
      3. NEVER commit this key to git
      4. Consider using a secret management service (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)

  - id: "SEC-003"
    severity: medium
    category: "Authentication Security"
    finding: "ALLOW_AUTH_BYPASS=true in backend/.env - must disable for production"
    location: "backend/.env:16"
    details: |
      Development auth bypass is currently enabled:
      ALLOW_AUTH_BYPASS=true

      This bypasses Clerk authentication and uses DEV_USER_ID instead. While this is
      properly implemented with warnings in the code, it MUST be disabled for production
      to prevent unauthorized access.
    suggested_action: |
      **Before deployment:**
      1. Set ALLOW_AUTH_BYPASS=false in production .env
      2. Ensure CLERK_SECRET_KEY is properly configured for production
      3. Test authentication flow in staging environment
      4. Add deployment checklist to verify this setting

  - id: "DEP-002"
    severity: low
    category: "Dependency Vulnerability"
    finding: "Clerk SDK has 3 low-severity vulnerabilities (cookie parsing)"
    location: "backend/package.json:31-32"
    details: |
      @clerk/clerk-sdk-node (v4.13.23) has transitive dependency on vulnerable cookie package.

      Vulnerabilities:
      - cookie package accepts out-of-bounds characters in name, path, and domain
      - CVSS Score: Low severity

      Fix available via major version upgrade to @clerk/clerk-sdk-node@5.1.6
    suggested_action: |
      Evaluate upgrade path to Clerk SDK v5:
      ```bash
      cd backend
      npm install @clerk/clerk-sdk-node@5.1.6 @clerk/express@latest
      ```

      **Note:** This is a major version upgrade - test thoroughly before deploying.

    - "Use unique secrets for each environment (dev/staging/production)"
    - "Rotate API keys regularly (quarterly minimum)"
    - "Monitor API key usage for anomalies"
    - "Set up billing alerts for API usage"
    - "Use separate database credentials for each service/environment"
    - "Never log or display secrets in application code"
    - "Use .env files ONLY for local development"
    - "Document all required secrets in .env.example files"

# GATE DECISION RATIONALE
# ============================================
decision_rationale: |
  **GATE: FAIL** ‚ùå

  This application CANNOT be deployed to production until critical security
  issues are resolved. The gate decision is based on:

  **Blocking Issues (P0):**
  1. **API Key Compromise**: Active Anthropic API key is exposed and must be
     rotated immediately. Deployment with this key would risk unauthorized
     usage and potential service disruption.

  2. **High-Severity Vulnerability**: Axios DoS vulnerability (CVSS 7.5) could
     allow attackers to exhaust server resources. This is a production-critical
     security fix.

  3. **Weak Encryption**: Default encryption key compromises OAuth token security.
     If tokens are intercepted, they could be decrypted using the predictable key.

  4. **Authentication Bypass**: While properly implemented for development, the
     ALLOW_AUTH_BYPASS flag MUST be disabled for production to prevent unauthorized
     access.

  **Estimated Remediation Time:**
  - Fix all P0 blockers: ~30 minutes
  - Complete deployment infrastructure: 4-8 hours
  - Full production deployment with testing: 1-2 days

  **Once P0 issues are resolved, the gate can be re-evaluated to CONCERNS or PASS.**

  The codebase shows good security practices overall (no hardcoded secrets,
  proper authentication, token encryption). The issues found are primarily
  configuration and dependency-related, which are straightforward to fix.

# NEXT STEPS
# ============================================
next_steps:
  immediate:
    - step: 1
      action: "Rotate Anthropic API key"
      owner: "Developer"
      details: |
        1. Go to Anthropic Console: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
        2. Delete/disable the exposed key
        3. Generate new API key with usage limits
        4. Update backend/.env.local (for development)
        5. Add to SECURITY_PATTERNS.EXPOSED_PREFIXES in apiKeyValidation.js

    - step: 2
      action: "Update axios dependency"
      owner: "Developer"
      details: |
        cd backend
        npm update axios
        npm audit
        npm test (verify no breaking changes)

    - step: 3
      action: "Generate ENCRYPTION_KEY"
      owner: "Developer"
      details: |
        # Generate key:
        node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"

        # Add to backend/.env.local for testing:
        ENCRYPTION_KEY="<generated_base64_key>"

        # Store securely for production deployment

    - step: 4
      action: "Create production deployment plan"
      owner: "Developer/DevOps"
      details: "Document Hetzner VPS setup steps, create deployment scripts"

  before_deployment:
    - "Complete pre-deployment checklist (see above)"
    - "Set up staging environment for testing"
    - "Run full integration tests with production-like configuration"
    - "Conduct second security audit after fixes applied"

  post_deployment:
    - "Monitor application logs for errors"
    - "Monitor API usage and costs"
    - "Set up automated backup verification"
    - "Schedule dependency audit (monthly)"
    - "Plan Clerk SDK upgrade (if needed)"

# AUDIT METADATA
# ============================================
audit_metadata:
  conducted_by: "Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)"
  audit_date: "2025-10-14"
  audit_duration: "~45 minutes"
  scope: "Pre-deployment security audit for Hetzner VPS migration"
  methodology: |
    1. Secret detection scan (grep for API keys, tokens, credentials)
    2. Git history analysis (check for committed secrets)
    3. Environment variable review (.env files, configuration)
    4. Dependency vulnerability scan (npm audit)
    5. Authentication and authorization review
    6. Database security assessment
    7. Deployment readiness evaluation

  tools_used:
    - "grep/ripgrep for secret detection"
    - "git log for history analysis"
    - "npm audit for dependency scanning"
    - "Manual code review of security-critical files"

  files_reviewed:
    - ".gitignore"
    - ".env, backend/.env, backend/.env.local"
    - "backend/src/middleware/clerk.js"
    - "backend/src/middleware/apiKeyValidation.js"
    - "backend/src/services/encryption.js"
    - "backend/prisma/schema.prisma"
    - "backend/package.json"
    - "Various configuration and script files"

  limitations:
    - "Frontend security audit not completed (directory inaccessible)"
    - "Runtime security testing not performed"
    - "Production infrastructure not yet deployed (cannot audit)"
    - "Database not accessible during audit (empty/not created)"
