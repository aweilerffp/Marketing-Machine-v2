# 🧪 Testing Marketing Machine

## ✅ **What's Currently Running**

### Frontend (http://localhost:5173)
The React frontend is now running! You can test:

1. **Landing Page** - Clean marketing site with authentication
2. **Authentication** - Clerk-powered sign up/sign in (needs Clerk keys)
3. **Dashboard** - User interface with stats and quick actions
4. **Onboarding Flow** - Multi-step company setup form
5. **Approval Queue** - Content review interface (shows mock data)
6. **Settings** - Brand voice, integrations, scheduling preferences

## 🔧 **What You Can Test Right Now**

### 1. **UI/UX Flow (No Backend Needed)**
- Visit http://localhost:5173
- See the landing page design
- Navigate through all the pages
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes

### 2. **Frontend Components**
- Landing page with hero section and features
- Navigation between pages
- Form interactions in onboarding
- Mock content in approval queue
- Settings tabs and form inputs

## 🚫 **What Needs Setup to Test Fully**

### Authentication (Clerk Setup Required)
```
1. Sign up at https://clerk.com (free tier available)
2. Create new application
3. Copy publishable key to frontend/.env:
   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
4. Copy secret key to backend .env:
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
```

### Backend API (Multiple Dependencies)
```
# Needs PostgreSQL running
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql

# Needs Redis running  
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# Then run backend
cd backend && npm run dev
```

## 🎯 **Testing Scenarios**

### Scenario 1: Frontend-Only Testing
**What to test**: UI, navigation, forms, responsive design
**How**: Visit http://localhost:5173 and click around

### Scenario 2: Full Stack Testing
**What to test**: Authentication, API calls, database operations
**How**: Set up Clerk + PostgreSQL + Redis, then run both frontend and backend

### Scenario 3: Webhook Testing  
**What to test**: Read.ai webhook processing
**How**: Use tools like ngrok + Postman to send webhook payloads

## 📋 **Current Test Status**

✅ **Frontend**: Running and fully testable
⏳ **Backend**: Ready to run (needs database setup)
⏳ **Authentication**: Ready (needs Clerk keys)
⏳ **AI Services**: Placeholder (needs OpenAI key)
⏳ **LinkedIn Integration**: Placeholder (needs LinkedIn app)

## 🚀 **Quick Demo Script**

1. **Open http://localhost:5173**
